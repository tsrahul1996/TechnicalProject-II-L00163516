# Big Data Analytics using Machine Learning
Rahul Thayyil Sivan

we are going to use the topmost two machine learning
libraries and perform predictive analysis using various models
embedded in them. Youtube data-set is used to explore what
makes videos popular on various platforms. We are implementing
two models from Scikit-learn which are,
- Bayesian Ridge model
- Gradient Boosting Regressor model
Also two models from MLlib which are, 
- Gradient-Boosted Trees Regressor model
- One Vs Rest model
